## Dataset

The dataset should be retrieved from [UNB CIC IDS 2017 Dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html).

## Notebooks

Notebooks should be run sequentially. Byproduct files will be created during the process.

## To-Do

- **Remove Duplicate Code**: Refactor duplicate code into Object-Oriented (OO) classes.
- **Consider Temporal Variables**: Currently, the temporal variables are only considered per day split. This needs to be addressed for more comprehensive analysis.
- **Enhance Model Granularity**: Improve the granularity of the label prediction for more precise results.
